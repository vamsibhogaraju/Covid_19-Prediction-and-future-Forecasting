# Covid_19-Prediction-and-future-Forecasting

Forecasting real-time data using Machine learning has proved its significance in expecting better outcomes to improve future decision-making. ML models have been used in many application areas that require recognition and emphasization of harmful aspects. In this study we have tried to use Machine Learning models to forecast upcoming COVID-19 cases in India, considering the problem to be a burning topic at the current time. In general, Two Machine Learning models, Random Forest Regressor and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models have been discussed to forecast the number of Active cases for the next 30 days. The results produced by the study prove it is a good technique to use these models for the prediction of the COVID-19 pandemic.
